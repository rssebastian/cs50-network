# CS50 Network

This social media web app was built as a final project for CS50, Web Development track at Harvard University. The purpose of this app is for users to make accounts, create profiles showcasing their skillset, and connect with each other.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Redux, BootstrapCSS

**Server:** Node, Express, MongoDB

## Deployment

This project is currently deployed at https://quiet-journey-29557.herokuapp.com/. Heroku is removing its free tier soon, so I will update the URL once its deployed to a different site.
